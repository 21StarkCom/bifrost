# publish.sh — regenerate the marketplace from stark-skills, the RIGHT way.
#
# GitHub Actions are ENABLED: a push to stark-skills `main` auto-opens a
# `marketplace-sync` PR here that runs this same regen. Use this script for a
# MANUAL regen — a membership edit made directly in bifrost, or a local dry-run
# before pushing. It chains the error-prone two-step regen (sync -> golden ->
# build --fix -> build --check) that
# the CLAUDE.md gotcha warns about, so you can't commit a `sync` without a `build`
# and trip the drift gate.
#
# SEMVER POLICY (applied automatically): every change ships a version bump.
#   - Adding OR removing a skill (bundle membership change) -> MINOR bump of that
#     bundle. The root VERSION also takes a MINOR.
#   - Any other content change (a stark-skills edit that re-renders artifacts)
#     -> PATCH bump of each affected bundle (default). Root VERSION takes PATCH.
# So a deploy never ships un-bumped content, and add/remove is signalled as minor.
#
# Usage:
#   docs/scripts/publish.sh                                     # sync + patch-bump changed
#   docs/scripts/publish.sh --add-skill stark-gha-cost --bundle stark-ops
#   docs/scripts/publish.sh --remove-skill stark-foo --bundle stark-ops
#   docs/scripts/publish.sh --add-skill X --bundle Y --ci --deploy
#
# Env:
#   STARK_SKILLS   path to the stark-skills checkout (default: ../../stark-skills
#                  relative to this repo, i.e. a sibling clone)
#
# It does NOT commit, push, or open a PR — that stays a deliberate human step
# (the script prints the next commands). --deploy runs deploy-web.sh at the end.
